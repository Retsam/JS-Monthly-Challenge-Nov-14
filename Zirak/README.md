# Hi.

It was but a week ago when I heard rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "'Tis some visitor", I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door - only this, and nothing more". As I do to all my visitors, I ignored the call.

"WE SELL COOKIES" came a cry, sundering through the bleary silence. 'Twas odd, for this was no time to sell cookies, and the one who bellowed out 'tis cry had a voice somewhat husky, as if of a nearly grown male. Hungry for the truth and yearning for cookies, I got up and decided to answer the rapping, rapping at my chamber door.

And there standing amid the frozen drops stood a man, bearing no sign of cookies or the selling thereof. What more, 'tis was just one man, not at all what was declared upon! At first I was outraged, but as we gazed intently at one another, I realised that this man was of some familiarity.

"Zirak you fuckwit, do a js challenge" said Benjamin Gruenbaum.
"meh whatever" I replied, closing my chamber door.

And so it began.

## Creation

```sh
$ ./make.sh
```

One must have the following installed and in one's path:
* `dogescript` (`dogescript`)
* `lsc` (`livescript`)
* `sibilant` (`sibilant`)
* `stylus` (`stylus`)
* `tsc` (`typescript`)

Where the list is of the form: `executable` (`package name`)

## Motivation
We must create a future where one language is not the dictator. Nay! javascript must not, *may* not, rule with an iron fist, especially not one of those spikey fists, you know, the ones with spikes on each knuckle. It must, *may* be the harbinger of wisdom, of purity, of greater dialects! Of growth and of sprout!

## What
Yes, feed me your confusion! For you see, this tiny project is made up of not only one, but *three* languages, they be of html, css and javascript. And what's more, once you have reached the count of three, you must immediately jump to the count of eight, for eight be the number of counting, unless one also includes files such as this and make, in which case! One must count to 10, for 10 be the number of one's counting, and there shall be great joy at the girth and wirth of such merriment.

## What
We must, (nay, *may*) leverage the javascript platform as our lord and saviour, all praise our Dark Lord Cthulhu (a note to my spell checker: one does not simply ignore Cthulhu), for it is within our deepest of regrets we forge our dream land, and from this dream land shall we conquer France (because seriously, fuck France), and from this France we shall eat croissants, and there shall be merriment.

## Whatever you say dude
Feeeed meeeee.
