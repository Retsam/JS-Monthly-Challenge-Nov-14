I automated that process and made the number of copies a user defined parameter, while ensuring that the copies were offset by 1 pixel.\n\nI used a 3D cube mesh in my demo (with an ortho camera), but it should be trivial to convert it to a poly line.\n\nThe real meat and potatoes of this thing is in the custom shader (fragment shader portion):\n\n    uniform sampler2D tDiffuse;\n    uniform int edgeWidth;\n    uniform int diagOffset;\n    uniform float totalWidth;\n    uniform float totalHeight;\n    const int MAX_LINE_WIDTH = 30; // Needed due to weird limitations in GLSL around for loops\n    varying vec2 vUv;\n\n    void main() {\n        int offset = int( floor(float(edgeWidth) / float(2) + 0.5) );\n        vec4 color = vec4( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);\n\n        // Horizontal copies of the wireframe first\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_LINE_WIDTH; i++) {\n            float uvFactor = (float(1) / totalWidth);\n            float newUvX = vUv.x + float(i - offset) * uvFactor;\n            float newUvY = vUv.y + (float(i - offset) * float(diagOffset) ) * uvFactor;  // only modifies vUv.y if diagOffset &gt; 0\n            color = max(color, texture2D( tDiffuse, vec2( newUvX,  newUvY  ) ));    \n            // GLSL does not allow loop comparisons against dynamic variables.

This is due to the algorithm used and is a limitation of the solution. Having said that, for low line thickness and complex geometries, this is barely noticeable with the naked eye.\nThe joints between lines will show gaps for large enough line thickness. You can play with the Codepen demo to see what I mean. I started to implement a solution to this by adding a second &quot;diagonal pass&quot;, but it got a little hairy and I think this would only be an issue for higher line thicknesses (+8 pixels) or extreme line angles. If you are interested in this solution, you can look at the original source to see where I was going with it.\nSince this uses a full screen filter, you can only use the WebGL context for displaying objects of this thickness.

But you usually want more than just those two operations.\n\nBelow is what I use to ensure dangerous privileges have less of an impact on my process. It will stop an unprivileged attacker by adding a Deny ACE to the DACL. The deny ACE removes these rights and privileges:\n\n\nWRITE_DAC\nWRITE_OWNER\nPROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS\nPROCESS_CREATE_THREAD\nPROCESS_DUP_HANDLE\nPROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION\nPROCESS_SET_QUOTA\nPROCESS_SET_INFORMATION\nPROCESS_VM_OPERATION\nPROCESS_VM_READ\nPROCESS_VM_WRITE\nPROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME\nPROCESS_TERMINATE\n\n\nAs you can see, there&#39;s a lot more than just PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION and PROCESS_VM_WRITE. For example, I used PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE to take down nearly every anti-virus suite on Windows. See Old Dogs and New Tricks: Do You Know Where Your Handles Are?.\n\nWith that said, the improved DACL will not stop a privileged attacker like an Administrator. An administrator can just take ownership of your process and change the owner. Once the admin owns the process, they can do anything they want (an owner always has access to an object).\n\nThere&#39;s a way to stop Admins too. When CreateProcess is called to start your program, the CREATE_PROTECTED_PROCESS flag can be used. However, it requires a special signature that&#39;s usually reserved for drivers that handle rich content and media (like music and movies). See Protected Process on MSDN for reading.\n\n\n\nAnd if that&#39;s not enough reading, some anti-virus companies block the operations on their processes by directly patching kernel components, such as the System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) to extend Object Manager functionality.\n\nKernel patching is not supported by Microsoft and operating system integrity is enforced on the latest versions of the OS via Microsoft’s Kernel Patch Protection (Patch Guard), so its not used a frequently as in the past.\n\nBecause of Kernel Patch Protection and SSDT integrity, Microsoft provides Kernel Data and Filtering\nSupport API. I have not studied it, and I have no experience with it.\n\n\n\nThis is the code I use to harden my process. The meat and potatoes are in the function ProtectProcess. It creates a new DACL with improced allow and deny ACE&#39;s.\n\nThe idea of the two Pause&#39;s below is you can examine the process before it modifies its DACL, and after it modifies its DACL. Use a tool like Process Explorer from SysInternals (and the Security tab).\n\n#include &quot;Windows.h&quot;\n#include &quot;Aclapi.h&quot;\n#include &lt;StrSafe.h&gt;\n\n// If you are taking the time to protect the process, you realize the default DACL\n// on a process is relatively weak. Please also take the time to harden the DACL on\n// all threads . The code is nearly the same, except (1) open the thread rather than\n// the process, and (2) the constants which make up &#39;poison&#39; are different. See\n// http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/vista/process_vista.mspx.\n\n// Stricly speaking, SYSTEM and Administrator are not usually required since\n// the principals can (under most circumstances) bypass LSASS checks or make the\n// DACL more accommodating.\n\nvoid Pause(const char* message);\nDWORD ProtectProcess();\n\nint main(int /*argc*/, char* /*argv*/[])\n{  \n    Pause(&quot;Ready to add deny ACE.

But what it does not touch on is why &quot;Self Executing Anonymous Functions&quot; are used in place of &quot;new function&quot;. This was asked in the comments, but was not well described by the author. As this article is 4+ years old (and I&#39;ve not found the answer elsewhere online) I thought I&#39;d bring it here.\n\nIt&#39;s already within a closure, so? (see: What exactly is the point of this function construct? Why is it needed? which also doesn&#39;t answer my question =).\n\nAssuming the following setup code..\n\nvar MyNamespace = window.MyNamespace || {};\n\n\nWhich of these is preferred and why?\n\nMyNamespace.UsingNew = new function() {\n    var fnPrivate = function() {\n        return &quot;secrets1&quot;;\n    };\n\n    this.property = &quot;value1&quot;;\n    this.method = function() {\n        return &quot;property = &quot; + this.property + &#39; &#39; + fnPrivate();\n    }\n};\n\nMyNamespace.UsingSelfEx = (function() { //# &lt;- Added &quot;pre-parens&quot; suggested by chuckj\n    var fnPrivate = function() {\n        return &quot;secrets2&quot;;\n    };\n    var fnReturn = {};\n\n    fnReturn.property = &quot;value2&quot;;\n    fnReturn.method = function() {\n        return &quot;property = &quot; + this.property + &#39; &#39; + fnPrivate();\n    }\n\n    return fnReturn;\n})();\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nIt seems that like jQuery, all the cool kids are using &quot;Self Executing Anonymous Functions&quot; (SEAF)! But I just don&#39;t get this, as I find it much cleaner to use the .UsingNew approach as you expose the public functions at definition (rather than below in a return that needs to be maintained separately or being forced to use the inline object notation).\n\nThe argument for not needing &quot;that = this&quot; doesn&#39;t hold water for me for a number of reasons:\n\n\nIn order to avoid &quot;var that = this&quot; you end up either making a &quot;var obj&quot; plus a return statement (having to maint. a separate definition of what is public) or being forced to use the inline object notation (return {1,2,3}) for your public properties/methods.\nYou could always make a private variable of &quot;var that = this&quot; at the top of the class/namespace and use &quot;that&quot; throughout.\n\n\nNow... I suppose my development style may well make the .UsingNew pattern much easier to manage. My &quot;private&quot; functions are almost always &quot;static&quot; in nature, so I need to pass in the context anyway (supplanting the need for &quot;this&quot;). I have also taken up the habit of using an &quot;abbreviation&quot; namespace, so when I do need access to &quot;this&quot; I simply refer to the full object via the &quot;abbreviation&quot; namespace rather than via it&#39;s full path. E.G.:\n\nvar PrivateFunct = function() {\n    var rThis = Cn._.val; //# The abbreviated form of Cn.Renderer.Form.Validation\n    //...\n};\n\n\nor if it&#39;s a Private Static Function...\n\nvar PrivateStaticFunct = function(oContext) {\n    //...\n};\n\n\nOther then the reasons given above, I personally find the .UsingNew approach much more readable in the source. I&#39;ve got a pretty extensive codebase that uses the .UsingNew pattern here: http://code.google.com/p/cn-namespace/source/browse/Cn.Web/js/Cn/ with the Validation functionality probably the easiest to get your head around in 1 quick read thru. I also use some SEAF functions (see ErrorMessages.js.aspx) but only when they make sense.\n\nI could not imagine having to maintain separate returns to expose the public interfaces at the bottom! Yuck!\n\nNow, don&#39;t get me wrong, there are a number of places where a SEAF is very useful in order to enforce the closure, but I personally think it&#39;s overused within objects.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nUpon further reflection (and thanks to an extended discussion with Joseph under his answer) there seems to be some rules that can be applied to this DEATHMATCH:\n\nPer Douglas Crockford (see: JS we hardly new Ya) Anonymous functions should never use the &quot;new&quot; keyword because:\n\n\nIt is faster to use an object literal.\nBy using new to invoke the function, the object holds onto a worthless prototype object. That wastes memory with no offsetting advantage. If we do not use the new, we don’t keep the wasted prototype object in the chain. (NOTE: prototype calls come after the constructor definition, and as SEAF or &quot;new&quot; anonymous functions are fired imminently one cannot use prototype with them)\nIt requires less code to use an object literal. (while true, I have to disagree as I hate the object literal notation, I&#39;d much prefer to use ;&#39;s rather then ,&#39;s as it&#39;s more readable).\nIt is never a good idea to put new directly in front of function. For example, new function provides no advantage in constructing new objects.\n\n\nSo it seems the meat and potatoes of the matter is this: SEAF&#39;s are preferable to var obj = new function() {...}; due to speed and less overhead (no unneeded prototype object). What you have to suffer through is the fact that you are forced to use object literal notation (so ,&#39;s rather than ;&#39;s between your public members) or to maintain a separate list of public objects in a return object.\n\nSEAF&#39;s are not advisable when you are intending the function to work as an object constructor as instanceof will not work as expected (see: creating objects from JS closure: should i use the “new” keyword?).\n\nANSWER:\n\n\nIf it&#39;s an anonymous function intended to function as a Singleton/Global Static Instance, use SEAF.\nIf you are intending it to function as a Constructor (to potentially represent multiple objects) or you are using .prototype, use a &quot;standard&quot; function definition and invoke with &quot;new&quot;, e.g.:\n\nfunction PseudoClass1() {}\n\nvar PseudoClass2 = function() {};\n\nvar myClass1 = new PseudoClass1();\n\nvar myClass2 = new PseudoClass2();\n\n\nI have to say, I am not happy with this answer ;) I find the .UsingNew pattern MUCH more readable in the codebase, but it is slower and uses more memory then SEAF due to the fact that the unused prototype reference is instantiated and left in the object chain.\n","excerpt":"Answer Embedded Below in UPDATE 2/ANSWER\n\nThanks to Joseph for helping me find the answer (even though I don&#39;t like it =).\n\nORIGINAL QUESTION\n\nWhile doing some research on best practices when using Na &hellip; ","title":"Deathmatch: Self Executing Anonymous Function -vs- &quot;new function&quot;"},{"owner":{"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c892b3d37e0b2292670bfd4495979e04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nightlytrails","link":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/1363471/nightlytrails"},"is_accepted":false,"answer_id":25880665,"question_id":25853450,"item_type":"answer","score":0,"body":"You go looking out for a vegetable in dinner tonight.

I need to map a model to my domain entities, specifically, I need to convert an identity value to the actual entity. No big deal, right? I&#39;ve done this in MVC with no problem. I will simplify what I am doing to expose the essentials.\n\npublic class EntityConverter&lt;T&gt; : ITypeConverter&lt;int, T&gt;\n        where T : Entity\n{\n   public EntityConverter(IRepository&lt;T&gt; repository)\n   {\n       _repository = repository;\n   }\n\n   private readonly IRepository&lt;T&gt; _repository;\n\n   public T Convert(ResolutionContext context)\n   {\n       _repository.Get((int) context.SourceValue);\n   }\n}\n\n\nRepositories are registered with Autofac, and are managed as InstancePerApiRequest because of session/transaction management. So, I need to register my converter in that same scope:\n\n builder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(EntityConverter&lt;&gt;))\n        .AsSelf()\n        .InstancePerApiRequest();\n\n\nThe Automapper config looks something like:\n\n var container = builder.Build(); // build the Autofac container and do what you will\n\n Mapper.Initialize(cfg =&gt; {\n      cfg.ConstructServicesUsing(container.Resolve); // nope nope nope\n      // configure mappings\n      cfg.CreateMap&lt;int, TestEntity&gt;().ConvertUsing&lt;EntityConverter&lt;TestEntity&gt;&gt;()\n});\nMapper.AssertConfigurationIsValid();\n\n\nSo here&#39;s the part that sucks. I am to understand Automapper requires the ConstructServicesUsing guy to be set before you build your config. If you set it later, it won&#39;t be used. The example above won&#39;t work because container is the root scope. If I try and resolve EntityConverter&lt;TestEntity&gt;, Autofac will complain that the requested type is registered for a different scope, and the one you&#39;re in ain&#39;t it. Makes sense, I want the scope created by WebApi.\n\nLet me pause a sec and cover one fact about WebApi dependency injection (I don&#39;t really think this is Autofac-specific). WebApi creates an IDependencyScope for the request, and stashes it in the HttpRequestMessage.Properties. I can&#39;t get it back again unless I have access to that same HttpRequestMessage instance. My AsInstancePerApiRequest scoping on IRepository and my converter thus rely on that IDependencyScope.\n\nSo, that&#39;s really the meat and potatoes of the problem, and I really frustrated with this difference from MVC. You can&#39;t do\n\n cfg.ConstructServicesUsing(GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolver.GetService);\n\n\nThat&#39;s equivalent to using container.Resolve. I can&#39;t use \n\n GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolver.BeginScope().GetService\n\n\nbecause A) that creates a new scope next to the one I actually want B) doesn&#39;t really let me clean up the new scope I created. Using Service Locator is a new way to have the same problem; I can&#39;t get to the scope WebApi is using. If my converter and its dependencies were single instance or instance per dependency, it wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but they aren&#39;t, so it is, and changing that would create lots more problems for me.\n\nNow, I can create AutoMapper config with Autofac and register it as a single instance. I can even create per-request IMappingEngine instances. But that doesn&#39;t do me any good if the service constructor always uses that single delegate you register at the beginning, which has no access to the current scope. If I could change that delegate per each mapping engine instance, I might be in business.
